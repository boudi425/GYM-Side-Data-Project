BLACK GYM, One of my biggest if not the biggest project ever!,
The Project starts with simple logic, Like the First_InterFace file,

This File Contains The Sign, Login, Report Section,
Each of them have methods and values that applies to the methods.

A quick review of them will be like this:
Sign class takes values from the Client => (Email, Name, Password, Age, Weight, Height, Activity),

after all of the logic flow and management of this data, It gets transferred to the Login class
Login class takes => (Email, Password), as The user chooses from stayed logged or not, we create the userSession.json and the token,

report is nothing like this at all, it takes a Name, A report type Problem and the TextBox as a final input and it gets inserted to a separated db

After all of this we go to the Fitness&Calories to collect more data, As we know this data will either help earlier or even now
Gender is must, The rest are not that effecting in terms of calories but the Fitness It will affect a lot, as we actually should even look out for the plans details,

after all of this it gets saved to a db, and the user gets switched to the MainMenu

in the Main Menu Interface, We have tabView which is a full functional tab that when gets clicked, launches a new topLevel that contains the thing of it
also we have the sidebar which do the same thing but not a topLevel it is an actual frame that gets updated due to click of the button

after all of this we get the main four buttons => calories, myPlan, Exercise and finally is Journey!
This is the tricky part, Since i never really did so much data management and data manipulation,

I started with the Calories because, this the hardest class of all of them, Has a lot data flowing and coming and inserting and going on on,
So i thought it would be better to start with it, I build it with a certain structure but i got back to the normal structure as the code was so messy,
there was a lot of nested functions also, Which is a bad thing, Anyways, after finishing most of the calories Frames and logic, I can or i should really say that
I wish the rest are easy, YES! not the same as this one please, I can tell from how i managed the data of the calories that the exercises will have less logic and less data
but The myPlan and Journey will be the easiest as it depends on a data is already here and ready to get either analyzed or getting filtered or ordered by a way or another
The thing which is getting my mind crazy is how long the rows will be and how much will be data that getting inserted and analyzed during the session of the program
The rate us! button is just a small feature that allows me to communicate with the users,
and the project will get published as a beta version which will have a lot of features that don't work fully or don't even do anything

if you are still reading, Thanks a lot, and hope me the best!,
